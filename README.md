Individual Assignment
September  2024
Company Background: EduTech Innovations Ltd., a private university in Malaysia, is considering a significant investment to enhance its educational offerings. The university's management is keen on integrating the latest teaching equipment to provide an advanced learning environment for its students. This investment involves the purchase of state-of-the-art interactive whiteboards, virtual reality (VR) headsets, and advanced simulation software for its engineering and medical faculties.
Capital Requirement and Financial Projections: The estimated capital requirement for this technological upgrade is approximately RM1,000,000. This amount is allocated to acquiring the latest teaching equipment (RM800,000) and covering the installation and training costs (RM200,000).
Projections suggest that the new equipment will contribute to an annual net cash inflow of approximately RM220,000 by attracting more students and enhancing the university's reputation. The equipment is expected to have a useful lifespan of 8 years, with a residual value of 10% of the original cost.
To finance this investment, the university's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) proposes a funding structure that combines equity and debt. Specifically, 60% of the capital is to be raised through equity at a cost of 15%, while the remaining 40% will be financed through debt at a cost of 7%. This balanced approach is aimed at minimizing the overall cost of capital while ensuring the successful implementation of the project.
